## 1. Project Review Q&A Prompt

**Prompt:**  
“Prepare answers for commonly expected review questions for my IoT-Based EV Wireless Charging System project.”

**Context / Goal:**  
Prepare for a technical project review by simulating typical questions and model answers.

**Sample Output:**

- **Q: What is the role of the IR sensor in this project?**  
  **A:** The IR sensor detects the presence of the vehicle and triggers the charging process when aligned properly.

- **Q: How does the wireless charging system work?**  
  **A:** The system uses inductive coupling to transfer energy from the charging pad to the vehicle’s battery without any physical connectors.

- **Q: What safety measures are included in the system?**  
  **A:** The system includes automatic shutoff when the vehicle is not properly aligned and current regulation to prevent overheating.

- **Q: Why did you choose an IR sensor for detection?**  
  **A:** IR sensors are reliable, low-cost, and effective for detecting the presence and position of the vehicle in this setup.

**Why this prompt works:**  
- Clear instructions  
- Domain-specific  
- Structured Q&A format  
- Provides detailed, relevant answers for technical preparation

## 2. AI Farming Advisor – Real-World Prompting

**Project Title:**  
SmartAgri Advisor: AI-Powered Farming Guidance Prompt

**Problem Description:**  
Small farmers often struggle with unpredictable weather, pest issues, unclear market prices, and selecting the right crop. While many own smartphones, they lack access to simplified, tech-powered advice. This project offers an AI-based advisor that delivers clear, friendly, and practical farming guidance.

**Prompt:**  
“You are an AI farming advisor. A farmer will tell you about their land, crop, season, and current challenges. Analyze the situation step-by-step and provide clear, simple advice in bullet points for sowing, pest control, market prices, and crop choice. Keep the tone friendly and avoid technical terms.”

**Sample Input and Output:**

### 👤 Farmer:
> I have 2 acres of land. I want to grow tomatoes in July. Last year, pests destroyed my crops. I also don’t know the current market price and if tomatoes will sell well.

### 🤖 AI Advisor:
**🌱 Sowing Tips:**
- July is a good time to plant tomatoes, especially with the rains starting.
- Make sure the soil is soft, not waterlogged.
- Use good-quality seeds or healthy seedlings from a trusted nursery.
- Leave enough space between plants so air can pass — this helps prevent disease.

**🐛 Pest Control Tips:**
- Since you had pest problems last year, start checking your plants early — look for curled leaves or holes.
- Use neem oil spray once a week; it’s natural and keeps many pests away.
- Place yellow sticky traps around the field to catch flying insects.
- Don’t wait too long — if pests increase, ask your local shop for a mild, safe pesticide.

**💰 Market Price Advice:**
- Tomato prices often go up just after heavy rains when supply is low.
- Use apps like Agmarknet, eNAM, or call local mandi agents to check daily prices.
- If possible, store tomatoes for a few days and wait for a better price.

**🌾 Crop Choice Advice (Future Planning):**
- Tomatoes are fine for July, but you can also grow chillies or brinjal nearby.
- Try staggered planting (every 2 weeks) so the entire crop doesn’t ripen at once.

### 👤 Farmer:
> I have limited water from my borewell. Should I grow wheat or bajra in the winter season?

### 🤖 AI Advisor:

**💧 Water Availability Check:**
- Wheat needs more water at several stages (sowing, tillering, grain filling).
- Bajra needs less water and survives dry conditions better.
- 👉 Since water is limited, bajra is the safer option.

**💰 Profit & Market Advice:**
- Wheat has stable demand, but needs more inputs and cost.
- Bajra is cheaper to grow and in demand for animal feed and health products.

**✅ Suggestion:**
- Grow bajra — lower cost, lower water risk.
- If rainfall improves, test a small wheat patch.
- Let me know your choice — I can help with sowing tips next!

### 👤 Farmer:
> I planted sugarcane last year but didn’t get a good price. I have good water, a tractor, and medium black soil.

### 🤖 AI Advisor:

**🌾 Best Crop Options for You:**

✅ **1. Cotton**  
- Grows well in medium black soil.  
- Moderate water needs.  
- Good market price, especially hybrid or Bt cotton.  
- Add short-duration pulses for extra benefit.

✅ **2. Soybean**  
- Less water, improves soil fertility.  
- Harvests faster than sugarcane.  
- Often profitable.

✅ **3. Vegetables (e.g., tomato/onion)**  
- With water and a tractor, you can manage them well.  
- High income if timed right.  
- Needs regular care and market checks.

**💰 Market Tips:**
- Check last year’s mandi prices before sowing.
- Visit your local Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK) for best hybrid seed advice.

**✅ Suggestion:**
- Go with cotton or soybean for steady returns.
- Try vegetables on a small plot for fast profit.
- I’ll support you with sowing and care tips next 🌾
