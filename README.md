Hi! I'm KOTHA ANUSHA, a final -year B.Tech student(2022-2026) exploring prompt engineering with LLM like ChatGPT. HEre are some of my best prompts,what problems they solve, and sample outputs.


1. Project Review Q&A Prompt
   Prompt:  
          “Prepare answers for commonly expected review questions for my IoT-Based EV Wireless Charging System project.”

   Context / Goal:  
                  Prepare for a technical project review by simulating typical questions and model answers.

   Sample Output:  
                 Q: What is the role of the IR sensor in this project?  
                 A: The IR sensor detects the presence of the vehicle and triggers the charging process when aligned properly.

                 Q: How does the wireless charging system work?  
                 A: The system uses inductive coupling to transfer energy from the charging pad to the vehicle’s battery without any physical connectors.

                 Q: What safety measures are included in the system?  
                 A: The system includes automatic shutoff when the vehicle is not properly aligned and current regulation to prevent overheating.

                 Q: Why did you choose an IR sensor for detection?  
                 A: IR sensors are reliable, low-cost, and effective for detecting the presence and position of the vehicle in this setup.
